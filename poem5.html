        <p style="font-size: 25px;">One of the biggest mysteries of all time has been the Mystery of the 
            Bermuda Triangle. Anything that flies over this natural vacuum or tries to go near it loses itself 
            to the disastrous Devil Triangle. Many scientific  theories have tried to find the reasons behind the 
            suspicious happenings near Bermuda Triangle but have  never found justified reasons. Science 
            might not have been successful in uncovering the secrets of this triangle but it seems as if 
            Hindu history has something stored in their treasure box.
        </p><br>

        <p style="font-size: 25px;">There is an interesting story in Sundara Kanda, the fifth book in Ramayana 
          where Lord Hanuman encounters the energy above the sky of the ocean similar to the energy of the 
          mysterious Bermuda Triangle. Sundara Kanda depicts the adventures of Lord Hanuman.

            Demoness Simhika meditated for thousand years so that Lord Brahma could bestow her some desired powers. 
            Contented Lord Brahma asked her about what powers she wanted. To this, she demanded a boon of 
            attracting anything irrespective of its powers towards herself. She was also known as Chhayagrahi 
            as she was capable of grasping objects or beings merely with their shadows. She was strong 
            enough to swallow anything she wished to.<br><br>

            Once, Lord Hanuman in search of Mata Sita was flying over the Ocean, he realized that his speed 
            was lowered and he felt powerless due to some invisible force.<br><br>

            After a few moments of analyzing he saw demoness Simhika trying to pull him towards her through 
            his shadow. A battle was now ensured. Using his brains, Lord Hanuman decreased his size, entered 
            the demoness' body and destroyed all her internal organs. It is believed that she fled to some 
            mysterious place. The place where she is hiding might be the Bermuda Triangle. Familiar lines 
            between Chhayagrahi’s boon and capability of the Bermuda Triangle to grab things could be drawn.<br><br>

            We all know that the demon king Ravana had a gem in his navel which had a boon of immortality. 
            Lord Rama killed Ravana by shooting his navel with an arrow.After his death the gem became imperative. 
            It was necessary to place the gem at a place that would soak its endless power. 
            Lord Hanuman was given the duty to find this place. He took the gem to the deepest core of the ocean 
            so that its impact if not ended could be minimized. <br><br>
            
            It is said that both the gem and Samhita are still in the ocean. That place might be the Bermuda Triangle.

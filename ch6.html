      <div class="transbox">
          <p>
            I think that life in Rameswaram in the 1940s must have been very different from how it must be today. 
            People were orthodox and did not accept changes in their way of living. They would have been hard working. 
            The story mentions the way some people at Rameswaram used to differentiate among various social groups. 
            They were more religious.<br><br>
            It was a time of freedom struggle. All over India, people were struggling for independence. Everyone 
            joined together forgetting their backgrounds, religion, caste etc. This also impacted the people in 
            Rameswaram. People such as Sivasubramanai Iyer and Lakshman Sastry tried to bridge these differences. 
            They wanted to promote equality amongst the people. <br><br>
            It was the time religions were set aside. Education and equality were given more importance. Parents 
            wanted their kids to be educated and make the country a better place.
            Everyone knew that the country would become a better place in a few years. The change had begun.

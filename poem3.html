            <p>Question 1.<br>
                When you were a young child, did your mother tuck you in, as the poet’s mother did?<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Ans.</u>Yes, when I was a child, my mother used to tuck me in. Not just then, even today 
                she tucks me in. We both love to sit next to each other. The best part is when I wantedly 
                call my brother. When he looks at us so close, he tries to squeeze in between us.

            <p>Question 2.<br>
                Do you like rain? What do you do when it rains steadily or heavily as described in the poem?
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Ans.</u> I love rain, especially when it is a light and steady drizzle. I wontedly try to 
                stay out in the rain. When it is a light one, my cousin sisters are my best partners to have 
                fun. I and my cousin Snigdha love opening the window and getting wet. We both usually prefer 
                to take a walk in the rain. When I was young, I and my cousin Diya used to dance in the song 
                “Cham Cham” from Bhaagi. It was our favourite thing to do.<br>
                When the rain is heavy and there is no power, my family usually spends time together in our 
                living room. We talk to each other, play a game, tell stories and sometimes play games. 
                At this time, we put all our gadgets aside.

            <p>Question 3.<br>
                Does everybody have a cosy bed to lie in when it rains? Look around you and describe how 
                different kinds of people or animals spend time, seek shelter, etc. during rain.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Ans.</u> No, not everyone has a cosy bed to lie in when it rains. There are many slum 
                dwellers, beggars who are homeless and have to look for a dry spot to rest their heads. 
                They take shelter at the railway platforms, bus terminals, under the bridges, inside the 
                under-construction buildings, etc.
                I have myself seen such a situation. While I was going back home one day, there was heavy 
                rain. The community hall near my house was filled with people who were trying to protect 
                themselves from the rain.
                One of the biggest problems that stray animals face during the rainy season is the absence 
                of a permanent roof for them. Animals struggle to find shelter during heavy rains. During 
                heavy rains, dogs near my house usually howl loudly. Maybe they are trying to signal to each other.

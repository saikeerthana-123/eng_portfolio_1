                I read a few stories from the book ‘The Wit of Tenali Raman’ by Devika Rangachari. 
                The story starts from his childhood to when he was in the court of Krishnadevaraya. 
                After the death of his father, Raman and his mother moved to Tenali where his uncle 
                lived. That was how he came to be known as Raman of Tenali, or Tenali Raman.
                <br><br>
                Tenali Raman was known to be an intelligent child. Raman was a prankster. Due to this,
                teachers would refuse to accept him as their student. Despite the lack of education, 
                his thirst for knowledge kept him going. He learnt as much as he could. Young Raman 
                would either search for victims for his pranks or take a nap under his favourite palmyra tree. 
                <br><br>
                Once Raman met a sanyasi who taught him a mantra to awoke goddess Kali. She appeared in front. 
                By looking at the goddess’s attire, Raman started laughing. He stated that cold, with just one 
                nose, would trouble him. The goddess had hundreds of heads. Raman found it funny to imagine 
                such a situation. Puzzled, the goddess asked, “Why are you laughing, Rama? What is so funny?” 
                Ramakrishna apologized for his behaviour. Goddess Kali laughed at his joke and said, “Rama, 
                I like your sense of humour. I have come to grant you wishes. Look! I have two bowls in my 
                hand; one contains sweet milk. Upon drinking it, you would acquire great knowledge of the 
                world. And the other bowl contains curd, which would give you wealth. But you can choose only 
                one bowl, so think carefully and pick one.” Rama stayed silent for some time and then replied, 
                “Kali Ma, can I taste both before drinking them?” The goddess agreed and gave him both the 
                bowls. Before the goddess Kali could realize what Rama was doing, he drank from both the 
                bowls. The goddess was furious. Raman replied that one without the other was useless for 
                him. Goddess Kali was impressed by his quick thinking and intelligence and blessed him, 
                saying that he would become a great poet and would be known for his intelligence and sense of humour.
                <br><br><br>
                From this story, I learnt that we must not hesitate to speak your mind. We must always be bold and 
                do the right thing.
